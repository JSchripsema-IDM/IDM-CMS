==================
Welcome to |CMS_l|
==================

The |IDM_l| develops disease modeling software that is thoroughly tested and shared with the
research community to advance the understanding of disease dynamics. This software helps determine
the combination of health policies and intervention strategies that can lead to disease eradication.

The primary software, |EMOD_s|, is an agent-based :term:`stochastic` model that simulates the
simultaneous interactions of agents in an effort to recreate complex phenomena. |CMS_s| is also
stochastic, but uses the compartmental modeling framework to run faster, simpler simulations.
