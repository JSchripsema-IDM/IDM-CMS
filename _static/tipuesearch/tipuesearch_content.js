In terms of the errors of the diffusion solvers, they are all first-order in time and second-order in space, and are therefore similar to using one of the leaping algorithms for the simulation of diffusion processes. The diffusion methods however execute single reaction events per time-step, as opposed to leaping algorithms that execute multiple reaction events per time-step, and are therefore useful if the modeler chooses to capture detailed events.

The solver then employs these biasing parameters in selecting the next reaction and the next time step, yielding a trajectory weight that is a product of likelihood ratios from importance sampling.

If they biasing parameters are not provided in the .json configuration file, sdwSSA will execute multilvel cross-entropy (CE) method prior to the sdwSSA simulation to obtain optimal (minimum CE) biasing parameters. The overall flow of the algorithm is the same as the sdwSSA solver. After sdwSSA simulations finish, an estimate of the rare event with a confidence interval are returned as output [2] . .json file template { \"duration\" : 70 , \"runs\" : 100000 , \"solver\" : \"sdwSSA\" , \"sdwSSA\" : { \"reExpressionName\" : \"reExpression\" , \"reValName\" : \"SIR-RE-val\" , \"crossEntropyThreshold\" : 0.01 , \"crossEntropyMinDataSize\" : 300 , \"crossEntropyRuns\" : 100000 , \"gammaSize\" : 20 , \"binCount\" : 15 , \"biasingParametersFileNate\" : \"SIRS_biasingParameters_custom.json\" , \"outputFileNate\" : \"SIR_sdwSSA_1e5.txt\" } } .json syntax for sdwSSA solver takes a string as an input. sdwSSA is the only valid names to run this solver. reExpressionName takes a string as an input, which is the name of the function that defines the rare event expression in .emodl model file. If reExpressionName field is missing in the .json file, then the sdwSSA solver will search .emodl file for reExpression as the default name of the function. reValName takes a string as an input, which is the name of the parameter that defines the rare event value in .emodl model file. If reValName field is missing in the .json file, then the sdwSSA solver will search .emodl file for reVal as the default name of the parameter. gammaSize takes a positive integer as an input and defines the initial length of importance sampling parameters per reaction . binCount takes a positive integer greater or equal to 10 as an input. It specifies the minimum number of data required to maintain a single bin (bins are merged otherwise until each bin contains at least binCount data). binCount is used only in multilevel cross entropy (CE) simulations and is not required for sdwSSA simulations. If binCount is missing in the .json file but required to run multilevel CE simulations, default value of 20 is used. biasingParametersFileName takes a string as an input. It is the name of the .json file containing importance sampling (IS) parameters, which are used in the sdwSSA simulations. If biasingParametersFileName is missing, default name is created in the form of modelName _biasingParameters.json and multilevel CE simulations are performed to compute optimal IS parameters prior to running sdwSSA simulations. crossEntropyRuns takes an integer greater or equal to 5000 as an input. It defines the number of trajectories simulated in each level of multilevel CE method. This parameter is used only in multilevel CE simulations and is not required for sdwSSA simulations. If crossEntropyRuns is missing in the .json file but required to run multilevel CE simulations, default value of 100,000 is used. crossEntropyThreshold takes a real value in (0, 1) as an input and defines the fraction of top performing trajectories chosen to compute an intermediate rare event. It is used only in multilevel CE simulations and not required for sdwSSA simulations. If crossEntropyThreshold is missing in the .json file but required to run multilevel CE simulations, default value of 0.01 (1%) is used. .. note: If slow convergence is detected during the multilevel CE simulations , the value of crossEntropyThreshold is decreased to 80 % of its previous value . crossEntropyMinDataSize takes an integer greater or equal to 100 as an input and defines the minimum number of successful trajectories required to compute an intermediate rare event. If crossEntropyMinDataSize is missing in the .json file, default value of 200 is used. If crossEntropyRuns \u00a0 x \u00a0 crossEntropyThreshold is less than crossEntropyMinDataSize , the multilevel CE method dynamically adjusts the value of crossEntropyRuns such that crossEntropyRuns is set to the smallest integer greater than crossEntropyMinDataSize divided by crossEntropyThreshold . outputFileName takes a string as an input. If outputFileNate is missing in the .json file, then a default name is used in the form of modelName _sdwSSA_1e log ( runs ), where the base of log is 10 and modelName is the name of the .emodl file. Recorded information includes runs , estimate for the rare event probability, 68% uncertainty, and sample variance.

Diffusion events are modeled as particles that transition to neighboring locales. The ISSA method is ideally suited for systems with a large number of particles, i.e. 1000 particles or more at each locale. In terms of the errors of the diffusion solvers, they are all first-order in time and second-order in space, and are therefore similar to using one of the leaping algorithms for the simulation of diffusion processes. The diffusion methods however execute single reaction events per time-step, as opposed to leaping algorithms that execute multiple reaction events per time-step, and are therefore useful if the modeler chooses to capture detailed events. Note that all of the diffusion solvers do not need explicit parameter specifications and will automatically use default parameters. .json TSSA file template { \"duration\" : 1024 , \"runs\" : 512 , \"solver\" : \"tssa\" , \"tssa\" : { \"epsilon\" : 0.01 , \"greensFunctionIterations\" : 100 , \"verbose\" : false } } A portion of an .emodl file is included below to show how diffusive events are specified for TSSA, DFSP, OTSSA ( locale site-1 ) ( set-locale site-1 ) ( species A::1 1000 ) ( locale site-2 ) ( set-locale site-2 ) ( species A::2 1000 ) ( reaction A1->A2 ( A::1 ) ( A::2 ) ( * D A::1 )) ( reaction A2->A1 ( A::2 ) ( A::1 ) ( * D A::2 )) Note that D represents the diffusion coefficient and that the reactions specify transitions of species A to neighboring locales. .json syntax for TSSA epsilon (optional) epsilon takes a float greater than zero 0 and much less than 1 and determines the error of the approximation. A value of close to zero is equivalent to a standard stochastic simulation and a value close to 1 is the most aggressive speedup (and largest error). A default value of 0.01 is used which can be overridden by the user. We recommend not changing this value. verbose (optional) verbose takes a true or false flag. If true, extra information is printed to the command line, which can be useful for debugging or testing the solver. greensFunctionIterations (optional for ISSA) greensFunctionIterations takes an integer value between 1 and infinity and is the number of iterations used to compute the fundamental solution of the diffusion equation. The default value is 100. Footnotes [1] Lampoudi, D.T. Gillespie, & L.R. Petzold, \u201cThe Multinomial Simulation Algorithm for Discrete Stochastic Simulation of Reaction-Diffusion Systems\u201d.
